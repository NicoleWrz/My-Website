  ## Description
 This portfiolio was made from scratch using HTML and CSS. A navigational bar including: About Me, Work, and Contact was made. When clicked, the UI scrolls down to the section that corresponds with it. There is an about me section using borders with a short bio about myself inside. Next, a section for my work was added with the first work bigger than the others. When hovering over the work, a soft darker glow appears behind the image. Lastly, a contact section with links for my email, linkedin, and github.
